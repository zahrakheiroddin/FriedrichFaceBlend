# Image Color Detector

This program opens a static image and displays the RGB color values of any pixel you click on. It is useful for quickly identifying colors in an image based on user-defined points.

## How It Works
1. Load any image file (e.g., `example_image.jpg`) into the script.
2. When you click on any point in the image, the RGB color of the pixel at that position is displayed on the image itself.
3. To close the program, press `q` on your keyboard.

## Instructions
1. Place your desired image in this folder and name it `example_image.jpg` (or modify the script to reference your chosen file).
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the `image_color_detector` folder, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python image_color_detector.py
